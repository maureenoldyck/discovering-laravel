            <h5 class="card-title text-info">Take Some Deep Breaths</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Take a cycle of three deep breaths in and out. Feel your belly rise and fall with each breath. Let your breathing return to normal and notice your thoughts. A mini meditation like this can calm your mind and refocus you on the important things in life.</p>

            <p class="card-text">H2O. Drink it. If you can, sit somewhere quiet as you sip. Avoid scrolling on your phone. Instead, focus on the present moment for the few minutes it takes to finish this glass. Give your brain the break it deserves.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title text-info">Stretch</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Try some simple stretches or do a few yoga poses. My personal favorites are downward facing dog, forward fold, and mountain pose. If you donâ€™t know how to do any of those, no worries. Start with some slow neck circles, shoulder scrunches and relaxing, and interlacing your fingers behind your back. When you get back to work, focus on keeping your posture straight.</p>
